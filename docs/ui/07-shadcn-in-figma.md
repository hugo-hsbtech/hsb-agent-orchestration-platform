# 07 — Getting shadcn/ui components into Figma (no code)

> Decision for this track: **Figma only, no local code.** We want to assemble screens from *real* shadcn/ui components inside Figma (faithful, not hand-rolled), themed to [Paper & Signal](./02-design-system.md). This note records exactly what's required to make that possible, because it needs a one-time manual step in the Figma app.

## The constraint

The Figma MCP can only use libraries **already accessible to the file**. Running `get_libraries` on the Conductor file (`wgCEx2MmeF3tGDeulGmVqI`) returns:
- **Attached/available:** Material 3 Design Kit, Simple Design System (SDS), iOS/iPadOS/macOS/watchOS/visionOS kits.
- **`libraries_available_to_add`: empty** — the MCP cannot pull an arbitrary Community file (including any shadcn/ui kit) on its own.

So shadcn/ui is **not reachable** until a shadcn Figma library exists in the user's team and is published.

## What's needed — one-time setup (done by the user in the Figma app)

1. **Obtain a shadcn/ui Figma kit.** shadcn's own list lives at **https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/figma** — there is **no official kit**; all are community-made. Prefer a **variables-based** kit (Figma variables for colors/radius/typography) — that is what makes retheming to Paper & Signal clean.
   - **Free Community files (recommended):**
     - **"shadcn/ui components"** by Sitsiilia Bergmann — well-structured, regularly maintained — https://www.figma.com/community/file/1342715840824755935 *(first choice)*
     - **"shadcn/ui design system"** by Pietro Schirano — crafted to match the code — https://www.figma.com/community/file/1203061493325953101 *(fallback)*
   - **Paid** alternatives (more complete, optional): shadcndesign.com · shadcnstudio.com/figma · shadcn.obra.studio · shadcnblocks.com
   - **Duplicate** the chosen file into your team ("Open in Figma" / Duplicate).
2. **Publish it as a team library.**
   - Move the duplicated file into your team (Pro plan → library publishing is available).
   - Assets panel → **Publish library**.
3. **Hand back to the agent.** Once published, it becomes addable to the Conductor file. Then the agent can:
   - `get_libraries` → confirm it now appears in `libraries_available_to_add`, and add it.
   - `search_design_system` (scoped to its `libraryKey`) → list its components.
   - `importComponentByKeyAsync` → drop its components onto the screens.

### Fastest hand-off
If you've duplicated a kit, just paste its **file link** here. The agent can read its components directly (`get_design_context` / `search_design_system`) and import by key.

## Theming the kit to Paper & Signal

shadcn/ui is **variable-driven**, which is the whole reason it retheme's cleanly. The kit will expose variables like:
`--background, --foreground, --card, --primary, --secondary, --muted, --accent, --destructive, --border, --input, --ring, --radius, --font-sans, --font-mono`.

Reskinning to Paper & Signal = repointing those variables at our tokens:

| shadcn variable | Paper & Signal value |
|---|---|
| `--background` / `--card` | `surface/canvas` / `surface/card` |
| `--foreground` | `text/ink` |
| `--muted-foreground` | `text/muted` |
| `--primary` | `brand/tide` |
| `--destructive` | `state/error` |
| `--border` / `--input` | `border/hairline` |
| `--ring` | `brand/tide-bright` |
| `--radius` | `radius/md` (8) |
| `--font-sans` | Hanken Grotesk |
| `--font-mono` | JetBrains Mono |
| (display) | Bricolage Grotesque |

Two ways to apply: (a) overwrite the kit collection's variable values, or (b) add a **"Paper & Signal" mode** to the kit's color collection and switch frames to it. The platform's **semantic state palette** (draft/staging/canary/production/running/error/paused) and **provider chips** stay as our own tokens — shadcn has no equivalent.

## Component coverage (what we'd map)

The shadcn primitives we need (all standard in any kit) map to the [02-design-system.md](./02-design-system.md) list: Button, Input, Textarea, Select, Combobox/Command, Checkbox, Switch, Badge, Card, Table, Tabs, Dialog, Sheet, Popover, Tooltip, Dropdown, Avatar, Breadcrumb, Toast, Skeleton, Progress, Separator, Sidebar, Chart. Our **custom composites** (Workflow Node, Promotion Lane, Step Timeline row, Chat bubble + routing badge, Background-task card, Version-State Badge, Provider Chip, Scorecard cell, etc.) are not in shadcn and stay bespoke — built *from* shadcn primitives + Paper & Signal tokens.

## Status / next action

- ⛔ Blocked on the one-time setup above (user action in Figma app).
- ✅ Ready on the agent side: import + retheme + swap the hand-built primitives (Badge, Provider Chip, Tabs/segmented — already built to shadcn spec) for the real kit components, then continue the screens.
- 🔗 Alternative if no kit is brought in: keep rebuilding shadcn primitives to spec in-file (already done for Badge / Provider Chip / Tabs) — fully in-Figma and on-theme, lower fidelity to "real shadcn".

## shadcn pilot findings (2026-05-25)

The one-time setup above has happened: the Conductor file (`wgCEx2MmeF3tGDeulGmVqI`) now subscribes to **"shadcn/ui components with variables & Tailwind classes — Updated January 2026 (Community)"** (`libraryKey lk-1865af9c…f294ea`, source `team`). This pilot tested swapping the Agent Catalogue's hand-built primitives for *real* imported shadcn components, rethemed to Paper & Signal. Work was done on an isolated **clone** — the canonical `23:3` was verified untouched after.

**Status: DONE_WITH_CONCERNS.** Import works and the retheme is faithful at screen scale, but the kit's published component keys point at *example/documentation frames*, not atomic primitives, and the kit's variables are **remote/read-only** — so a clean variable remap is impossible in-file; every swap is a per-instance override.

### Import mechanics — WORKS
- `importComponentByKeyAsync` / `importComponentSetByKeyAsync` succeed from the subscribed kit. No auth or availability errors. `createInstance()` on imported variants works.
- Kit component keys imported in the pilot: Button set `3d180da66113aba935827ccafb0cb5245aa3ea7b`; Button (example) `32f61cc2142d340523b7146f658e83c5a3450ca3`; Badge set `6dd09bda467636231718db7abae5b752a76082af`; Input `e595971f3dde8ccc2b78eb90ac7e60de9937e368`; Card (example) `969665763ffec8b06e08524bb3a5537e20d21f83`; Tabs (example) `c1b03efc4dc493d1e27472b5a3d60e4b3f6200e8`; Select set `d9b648b7f45f9abda1b72f0b6450c9e0cc32d986`.

### Retheme mechanism — per-instance override ONLY
The kit is variable-based, but its variables live in **remote library collections** (`mode` with only `light mode`/`dark mode`; plus `tw/font`, `tw/padding`, `tw/border-width`, `tw/stroke-width`). In the consuming file these are read-only:
- (a) **Overwrite the kit's variable values** — BLOCKED. `setValueForMode` on a kit variable throws *"Cannot write to internal and read-only node. Are you trying to modify a remote style or component?"*
- (b) **Alias the kit's variables to ours** — BLOCKED for the same reason (can't rebind a remote variable in this file).
- (c) **Per-instance overrides** — FEASIBLE and what the pilot used. After placing an instance, re-bind each paint to our P&S variables with `figma.variables.setBoundVariableForPaint(paint, 'color', psVar)` (e.g. button bg → `brand/tide`, label → `text/on-brand`, badge → `state/*` + `state/*-wash`, input → `surface/card`/`border/hairline`/`text/faint`). Token-driven, not hardcoded hex — good.
- (d) **Edit + republish the source kit file** — the only route to a true variable remap (add a "Paper & Signal" mode, or repoint `mode` values, in the kit's own file). Out of scope for in-file work; this is the clean rollout path if a full swap is pursued.

### The real blocker — published keys are example frames, not atoms
Every "primitive" except Input turned out to be a **multi-element showcase frame**:
- **Button** set variants are *rows of 3 buttons* (default/outline/ghost, ~267px, 3 text nodes). The standalone "Button" component key is an *Accept ⏎ / Cancel Esc* button-group example. The usable atomic button is a nested `FRAME "Button"` inside — reachable only by `createInstance()` → `detachInstance()` → extract the inner frame.
- **Card** key is a 368×394 form composite (header + labelled inputs + button rows) — not a container card. Not usable as the AgentCard shell without rebuilding.
- **Tabs** key is a 398×406 tab-strip-plus-demo-card; the inner `FRAME "Tabs" 160×36` is a clean atomic segmented control (extractable the same detach-and-lift way).
- **Input** `e595971f…` is genuinely atomic (231×36, placeholder text + lucide search icon) — the one clean drop-in.
- **Badge** set is a proper variant set (`Type` = default/secondary/destructive/outline/…number/icon) — atomic and usable via `createInstance()` on a variant; needs hug-fix (kit padding wraps long labels) + state-color override.

### What was swapped on the clone (all rethemed to P&S)
- **New agent button** → atomic shadcn Button (extracted from example), bg `brand/tide`, label `text/on-brand`. Clean.
- **Topbar search** → shadcn Input, `surface/card` + `border/hairline` + faint placeholder. Clean (icon sits right, vs left in the original — minor).
- **4 version-state badges** (3× Production, 1× Canary) → shadcn Badge `secondary`, fill `state/*-wash`, text `state/*`, hugged to single line.
- **ViewToggle (Blocks/Table)** → atomic shadcn Tabs strip (extracted), sunken track + white active pill + ink/muted labels.
- **Agent card shells** — NOT swapped (kit Card is a form composite; a faithful swap would mean detach + rebuild, no fidelity gain).

### Fidelity — good at screen scale
Side-by-side, the rethemed shadcn components are visually indistinguishable from the bespoke ones (warm paper, Tide accent, correct state colors). Two caveats: (1) the kit's text uses its own `family/sans`, **not Hanken Grotesk** — a font override per text node is required for type fidelity (the pilot set characters/colors but the family stays the kit's until explicitly overridden); (2) kit Badge padding is looser than our spec and needs a hug-fix.

### Effort to roll out (~26 screens + 6 journeys + Lists)
**Per-component override grind, not a clean remap.** Each instance needs: detach-and-extract (for Button/Card/Tabs/anything composite) + N paint re-binds + font-family override per text node + hug/size fixes. Estimate ~5–15 min per distinct component *type* to script a reusable helper, then bulk-apply — but composites (Card especially) approach the cost of just keeping our bespoke build. Realistic: a few days to swap the genuinely-atomic primitives (Input, Badge, the extracted Button/Tabs atoms) across all screens; the composites are not worth swapping.

### Recommendation — PARTIAL swap
- **Worth swapping:** Input, Badge (with hug-fix), and the *extracted* atomic Button and Tabs/segmented control. These are real shadcn, retheme cleanly, and are faithful.
- **Not worth swapping:** Card and any composite — the kit ships them as documentation examples, so the swap is a detach-and-rebuild with zero fidelity gain over our bespoke components. Our signature composites (Agent Card, Version-State Badge semantics, Provider Chip, Workflow Node, etc.) stay bespoke regardless.
- **If a full real-shadcn mandate is required:** do it the (d) way — fork the kit file, add a Paper & Signal variable mode there, republish — so instances retheme by *mode switch* instead of thousands of per-instance overrides. That is the only path that scales across 26 screens without an override grind.

### Pilot artifacts
- Pilot page: **`shadcn pilot`** = node `364:2`.
- Clone of Agent Catalogue: `364:3` (original `23:3` confirmed untouched).
- Swapped instance IDs: New agent button `377:73`; topbar Input `380:67`; badges `383:111`/`383:114`/`383:117`/`383:120`; ViewToggle Tabs `386:280`.

## P1 — rethemed shadcn primitives (2026-05-26)

P1 of the **partial swap**: formalized the 4 worth-swapping atoms into **canonical local components** on the Components page (`15:3`), in a new **"shadcn × Paper & Signal"** band (below the existing component shelf, starting y≈3600). Each wraps the pilot's real-shadcn atom (cloned from the pilot page `364:2`, then detached/componentized) and is fully rethemed to Paper & Signal. The bespoke Version State Badge (`20:23`) and all canonical Screens/journey frames were left untouched (P2 owns those).

### Component node IDs
| Component | Node ID | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Button (shadcn·P&S)** | set `392:77` | variants: `Variant=primary` `391:79` · `Variant=secondary` `392:74` |
| **Input (shadcn·P&S)** | `393:94` | single component, generic text field (search icon removed) |
| **Badge (shadcn·P&S)** | set `396:74` | 7 variants — see below |
| **Segmented (shadcn·P&S)** | `398:81` | 2-segment (Blocks/Table) from the kit Tabs atom |

Badge variant IDs: `State=draft` `395:74` · `State=staging` `395:78` · `State=canary` `395:82` · `State=production` `394:83` · `State=running` `395:86` · `State=error` `395:90` · `State=paused` `395:94`.

### Retheme method — same per-instance approach the pilot proved, now made canonical
Confirmed again: `importComponentByKeyAsync` works, but the kit's variables stay **remote/read-only**, so retheming is **per-instance paint re-binding** to our P&S variables (`figma.variables.setBoundVariableForPaint`), **plus** the two fixes the pilot flagged:
1. **Paint re-bind** — every fill/stroke/text fill bound by name to a P&S variable (`brand/tide`, `text/on-brand`, `text/ink`, `text/muted`, `text/faint`, `surface/card`, `surface/sunken`, `border/hairline`, `state/*` + `state/*-wash`, `radius/md`). No bare hex, no leftover kit colors.
2. **Font override** — every text node forced to **Hanken Grotesk** (SemiBold for button/badge/segment labels, Regular for the input placeholder); band title uses **Bricolage Grotesque SemiBold** (display register). The pilot's leftover **Inter** is gone.
3. **Hug / sizing fix** — Button height normalized to 36 + radius 8 (pilot was 32); Input 280×36 radius 8; Segmented track radius 8 (kit shipped 10); Badge built to hug (pad `[4,10,4,8]`, gap 6, radius full) with a **dot ellipse** added so it mirrors the bespoke Version State Badge (the kit Badge had no dot).

Rather than re-import-and-extract from keys (fragile detach-and-lift), P1 **cloned the pilot's already-extracted atoms** as the starting point (permitted reuse), then `detachInstance()` / `createComponentFromNode()` to turn them into clean **local** COMPONENT/COMPONENT_SET nodes — so they no longer point at the remote kit and can't drift when the kit updates.

### Theme-correctness — verified clean
Screenshotted each component (and the whole band). Confirmed: warm-paper surfaces, Tide accent on the primary button + active segment, Hanken type throughout, correct per-state badge colors. A programmatic audit of all 4 components returned **zero issues** — no non-P&S fonts, no unbound text fills, no bare solid fills. No kit-blue, no Inter, no wrapping, no 100×100 artifacts. The Badge set is visually identical to the bespoke Version State Badge (`20:23`) — same dot+label, wash fill, state-colored text; only the label string differs (`Error` here vs the bespoke `Failed`, per the task's variant naming).

### Effort signal for P2 rollout
Each atom took ~1 short scripted pass (clone → detach → componentize → re-bind paints → font override → sizing fix → verify). The genuinely-atomic primitives (Input, Badge, extracted Button/Tabs) are now **canonical and reusable** — P2 can instance these instead of re-rethemeing per screen, which collapses the per-instance grind for these four. The standing caveats hold: composites (Card etc.) are still not worth swapping, and a true variable remap still requires the (d) fork-and-republish path. Net: P1 removes the override cost for the four atoms across the screen set; P2's remaining work is swapping screen instances to these local components.
